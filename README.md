# Monopoly Game Simulation using C++ 🎲

This project is a console-based (CLI) simulation of the classic board game **Monopoly**. It was developed as a final assignment for the Data Structures course to demonstrate an understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and the implementation of **Data Structures**.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Game Mechanics:** Supports 2-4 players, double dice system, property purchase, rent, and jail.
* **Data Structures:**
    * **Circular Linked List:** Represents the game board (40 squares) so that players move around in a loop.
    * **OOP Class Design:** Uses the `Game`, `Player`, `Square`, and `Property` classes.
* **System Features:**
    * Bankruptcy & winner determination algorithms.
    * “Chance” & “Community Chest” cards with random effects.
    * Building upgrade system (House/Hotel).

## 📂 Documentation
