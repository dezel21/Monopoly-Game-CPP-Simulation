# Monopoly Game Simulation using C++ 🎲

This project is a console-based (CLI) simulation of the classic board game **Monopoly**. It was developed as a final assignment for the Data Structures course to demonstrate an understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and the implementation of **Data Structures**.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Game Mechanics:** Supports 2-4 players, double dice system, property purchase, rent, and jail.
* **Data Structures:**
    * [cite_start]**Circular Linked List:** Represents the game board (40 squares) so that players move around in a continuous loop[cite: 1785, 1815, 1828].
    * [cite_start]**OOP Class Design:** Uses the `Game`, `Player`, `Square`, and `Property` classes[cite: 1664].
* **System Features:**
    * [cite_start]Bankruptcy & winner determination algorithm[cite: 2120].
    * [cite_start]“Chance” & “Community Chest” cards with random effects [cite: 2076-2079].
    * [cite_start]Building upgrade system (House/Hotel)[cite: 2106].

## 📂 Documentation
Complete technical documentation is available in this repository:
* 📄 **Full Paper.pdf** (In-depth analysis)
* 📊 **Presentation Slides.pdf** (Architecture & Logic Diagrams)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** C++
